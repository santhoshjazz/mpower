							<h2>Want to Manage Your Business Stress ?</h2>
							<span>may 4,2020</span>
							<div class="blog_detail_img"></div>
							<p  class="description">
								If you are a start-up entrepreneur, you are probably ahead of many others but nevertheless, you face risks, uncertainties.
								Stress also comes along as a by-product for an entrepreneur. Either you end up having an unhappy family, discontented clients 
								or forlorn subordinates but finally, all of these affect your business, especially when you have a start-up.
							</p>
							<p>However, there may be many areas where not much can be done such as client meetings, deadlines, profits, etc.
							But then other factors can be well planned well to give it a smooth start. Here are some guidelines to help you manage your business stress -</p>	
							
							<h4>#1 Plan your Time Well in 10 Steps</h4>
							<p>This is one of the most important factors – that triggers a failure for many businesses. Therefore, mastering the skill of
							time planning can give you great results. Time is more powerful than money these days. So make use of it wisely.</p>
							<ol class="blog_list">
								<li>As per Pareto Principle,<strong><i>20% of your activities will contribute to 80% of the results</i></strong>  and vice versa. Great business 
								owners spend time on planning. They always carry a diary or a phone to a meeting so that they can take notes and plan 
								their calender.</li>
								<li><strong><i>Define the Key Result Areas in the organization</i></strong> for yourself and others in your team and get a tracking process in place. 
								This will ensure that everyone knows what they are responsible for and why they are in the organization.</li>
								<li><strong><i>Make a list of 3 important goals in all Six areas of life </i></strong>– Mental, Physical, Spiritual, Social, Family and Financial. 
								Record your time in each of these areas for a week and re-organize yourself if you need to. Remember, failing to Plan is 
								planning to Fail.</li>
								<li>There are busy times and then there are easy times.<strong><i> Spend Time with yourself to brainstorm,</i></strong> complete pending reports 
								or realign your goals when work is low.</li>
								<li><strong><i>Learn to Delegate to your subordinates.</i></strong>There is always a time in your business when you need to let go. Trust them, 
								provide correct information, give them freedom to perform & thank them. You will get enough free time for other 
								productive activities.</li>
								<li><strong><i>Plan your next day appointments a day in advance.</i></strong> Reconfirm your appointments, the same day in the morning. 
								Plan your questions & share with your clients before each meeting. Have a Plan B in case your client does not show up 
								e.g. a surprise date with your spouse or slide in another meeting with a client who is available!</li>
								<li><strong><i>Do the easy tasks first and keep the difficult ones for later.</i></strong> Plan which difficult ones need to be completed that day. 
								Quick appearance of things or people may not be urgent. Re-plan their appointment if required.</li>
								<li><strong><i>Give each of your tasks an alphabet &  number.</i></strong> E.g. A-1 means top priority, A-2 might be a top priority task but next 
								to A-1. B could mean attending office meetings. C would be spending time with a friend over lunch. Make a list and start 
								ticking them off upon completion.</li>
								<li><strong><i>Emails, Phone calls & text messages</i></strong> need not be answered just because they are showing up. Face book, twitter etc can
								be your focus only if they generate business. Else keep attending to emails & texts towards the end of your day. 
								Technology can be your friend but don’t become its slave!</li>
								<li><strong><i>Upgrade your Skills.</i></strong> If you wish to accomplish more than what you can today, then you need to get better than you were 
								yesterday. Continuous learning is a very important principle for success in any work or business and it can take you to the 
								next level!</li>

							<h2>8 Ways to Control Your Business with Right People Skills</h2>
								<span>may 4,2020</span>
								<div class="blog_detail_img people_skil"></div>
								<p  class="description">
								If you are out there to do business, learning to work with people is a must. For a business owner it’s a never ending quest 
								to learn about his employees, partners, clients, suppliers and the list goes on...
								</p>	
								<p>But <strong><i>a Good Leader is one who not only has a People Centric Approach but is looked up by people as well.</i></strong></p>
								<p>Understanding People can be very confusing. Handling people at different levels can create stress.
								What people say, what people do, and what they say they do are entirely different things.</p>
								<p>The suggestions mentioned below are straight forward & most of them will require constant attention for a little while, 
								until they become a habit. And then you'll not only be thrilled with your progress but you will see your business grow as well.</p>
								<ol class="blog_list">
									<li><strong><i>Learn to Listen, before Speaking:</i></strong> Remember, everyone wants to be “heard” and not “spoken” to. Most of the 
									miscommunication happens when we speak before listening. When you Listen you will know more and give out less.
									It will save you a lot of trouble and give you an edge in responding accurately, avoid unnecessary information being given 
									out & avoid any confusion. It will definitely be helpful, if you can learn to read between the lines.</li>
									<li><strong><i>Give to Get:</i></strong> Nature’s law says that if you give something to someone, there is a subconscious urge to return. 
									Whether it is an insult or respect. So choose carefully!</li>
									<li><strong><i>Walk the Talk:</i></strong>  Lead by example. Your subordinates are always watching you. Whatever you will do, will duplicate in 
									your organization. Integrity, Commitment & Loyalty are three core values of a successful business owner. Display these 
									in your day today tasks and your people will love you.</li>
									<li><strong><i>Connect with People:</i></strong> Everyone wants to feel important and people’s primary concern is always themselves. 
									Talk to them about what is important to them & treat them exactly as you would want to be treated.</li>
									<li><strong><i>Believe in your People:</i></strong> Showing belief in someone about something always has a psychological return of them actually doing 
									it. Encourage people in your organization by believing in them. Show your belief in their skills and they will start believing 
									in those as well.</li>
									<li><strong><i>Create an Open Culture:</i></strong> Focus on “We” rather than “Me”.  Let your people know that you encourage inputs and ideas from 
									everyone. Be open to their views. The main objective being to benefit the organization. Leaders do not force people to follow, 
									they empower people.</li>
									<li><strong><i>Giving Feedback:</i></strong> Give critical feedback alone and compliments in front of everyone. If you do need to give a feedback to 
									anyone, work on a "Sandwich Approach" – First Praise, then give Feedback, and finally give tips for Growth. </li>
									<li><strong><i>Personal Growth:</i></strong> The no. 1 differentiator for a successful leader is that they always seek personal growth. Keep working
									on your attitude and approach in dealing with people. It takes time, but you will get there.</li>

						<h2>How to stand out from other Sellers</h2>
						<span>may 4,2020</span>
						<div class="blog_detail_img seller"></div>
						<p  class="description">
							Today many sellers offer similar products with similar pricing and benefits. But the customers are looking for measurable 
							quality in the products and services they buy as they are more aware now than ever before. So, how can a seller retain 
							customer's loyalty and make them buy the product seller offers, each time and every time.
						</p>	
						<p>Here are a few tips that could work for you -</p>
						<ol class="blog_list">
							<li><strong><i>Be Open Minded & Enthusiastic-</i></strong> If you are closed with your own thoughts and not willing to
							understand other’s point of view, then that is the end of your opportunity in selling anything
							or doing any kind of business. Customers like to buy from a seller who is enthusiastic and
							open minded. So, the best thing you can do when you go on a sale is, to be happy & upright!</li>
							<li><strong><i>The Right Attitude – </i></strong>Remember it’s not so much the knowledge but the attitude that gets
							a sale. Understand the Law of Numbers. Be Excited. Every rejection takes you closer to
							your success. Be high on integrity, values, and ethics and you will win long lasting customers.</li>
							<li><strong><i>Become a User –</i></strong>If you have a coffee shop, and you have never tasted your coffee, why
							should others? Customers buy your belief and trust. If you love your coffee, so will they.
							Spend time in learning more about your products & services and about their benefits and  
							how they compare with the competition.</li>
							<li><strong><i>Questions are the Answers –</i></strong>Always ask Open Ended Questions. The ones starting with - "W"
							and "H" For e.g. What, Why, How, When, Who, Where. Let your customers speak about
							themselves. They will love you for it. Listen carefully. Limit your speaking time. Learn to hear
							the unsaid.</li>
							<li><strong><i>Connect with them–</i></strong>Give your customers a unique experience and make them feel special.
							Compliment them about how they look, about their family, home, anything close to their
							heart. Be there when they need you. Keep in touch on any special occasions. It’s not how
							much you know that matters but how much you care.</li>
							<li><strong><i>Win-Win for both –</i></strong> Focus on the customer’s needs, how your product can give value to them
							and their life. Learn to translate their needs into benefits. The entire approach should be
							“non manipulative” & for creating a win-win situation for both customer and you. Focus on
							educating your customer so that they understand what is in it for them. You will see that the
							sale will automatically happen!</li>
							<li> <strong><i>High Trust Selling –</i></strong> Begin with a mindset of commitment to a long-term relationship with
							your customers. Today’s customers buy differently, so today’s salespeople need to sell
							differently. Customers know there is no urgency to buy, because good deals, good
							salespeople, and good companies come along every day. Buyers are not just interested in
							great deals; they want great relationships.</li>
							<li><strong><i>Handling Objections :</i></strong> Never dismiss any objection. Be calm and composed. Use the onion
							peel approach and get to the real objection. Show a positive side to the objection. The tone is
							more important than what you say. Do not handle any objections that have not been brought
							up. Always remember, third Party approach works when nothing else does!</li>
							<li><strong><i>Closing the Sale :</i></strong> Close when your client wants to buy, not when you want to sell!! The best
							time to close is after successfully handling an objection. Transfer a sense of urgency to your
							client into buying now. Watch out..sometimes the closing is assumed.</li>
							<li><strong><i>Ask for Feedback :</i></strong> A post sale follow up is the most crucial step in the sales process but
							usually forgotten. Keep in touch with information on delivery dates, installation, training dates
							and other relevant information. Do take their feedback on the sale. This will ensure a long
							term relationship and bring in repeat and referral business.</li>
